This repository contains (part of) the code and resources developed for my MSc thesis titled "Modeling Circuits with Multiple N-port Nonlinearities in the Wave Digital Domain", dealing with the simulation of circuits using the Wave Digital Filters (WDF) framework, particularly dealing with circuits with an arbitrary number of multiport nonlinearities.
