Wave Digital Filters with Machine Learning for Nonlinear Circuit Simulation
This repository contains (part of) the code and resources developed for my MSc thesis titled "Modeling Circuits with Multiple N-port Nonlinearities in the Wave Digital Domain", dealing with the simulation of circuits using the Wave Digital Filters (WDF) framework, particularly when circuits with an arbitrary number of multiport nonlinearities.
